# Headers

 - Think of headers as types, not differrent things
 EG:
 ```<h1>sometext</h1> | CSS: H1{text-aligncenter}```
Now all of your <h1> elements will be centrally aligned.

# <div>
    - Think of divs as namespaces, you can have a different div do a different thing.
    - center a div by "display: center;" in CSS (target that div class!)
