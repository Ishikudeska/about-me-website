        <!---->
        <p>My favorite programming language is C#, as I enjoy how you can make each class have one purpose. While I know this is inefficient, I enjoy the simplicity it provides when bug-fixing/code reviewing.</p>
        <h2>Some things you should know about me</h2>
        <p>I over-comment my code. Each function, class, section, etc. has its own comment explaining what it does, and there's a document containing all these definitions externally.</p>
        <p>I am a perfectionist. I will spend hours on a single function to make sure it's perfect.</p>

        <h3>Some more stuff about me:</h3>
        <p>I am a DeMolay, and a Freemason.</p>
        <p>Current state 4th preceptor of Texas DeMolay</p>
